Q27: What are the consequences and remedies for the remaining five categories of offences in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A27: The remaining five categories of offences in the Vinaya Pitaka, considered light offences (lahukapatti), are remediable. Offenders must confess the transgression to another bhikkhu and carry out the prescribed penalty. After completing the penalty, the bhikkhu transgressor becomes cleansed of the offence.

Q28: What was the initial state of the disciplinary rules concerning Parajika and Samghadisesa offences in the early days of the Order?
A28: For the first twenty years after the establishment of the Order, there were no injunctions or rules regarding Parajika and Samghadisesa offences. The members of the Order during this period were all Ariyas, with the least advanced being a Stream-winner. As such, there was no need for rules regarding grave offences.

Q29: Why did the need for rules concerning grave offences arise after the initial years of the Order?
A29: As the Samgha grew in strength over the years, undesirable elements with impure motives, attracted by the fame and gain of the bhikkhus, began entering the Buddha's Order. After approximately twenty years, rules relating to grave offences, specifically Parajika, and Samghadisesa became necessary.

Q30: How did the first Parajika rule come to be established in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A30: The first Parajika rule in the Vinaya Pitaka was established due to the actions of Bhikkhu Sudinna, a native of Kalanda Village near Vesali. He committed the offence of having sexual intercourse with his ex-wife, prompting the need for a prohibitory rule to deter bhikkhus from engaging in such conduct.

Q31: How were the rules concerning grave offences established in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A31: When a significant cause, such as the offence committed by Bhikkhu Sudinna, arose, necessitating the establishment of a prohibitory rule, the Buddha convened an assembly of bhikkhus. After questioning the bhikkhu involved and clarifying the undesirability of such offences, a specific rule was laid down to prevent future lapses of a similar nature.

Q32: How did the Buddha establish rules in the Vinaya Pitaka, and what was the inspiration for these rules?
A32: The Buddha followed the precedence set by earlier Buddhas. Using his supernormal powers, he reflected on the rules that earlier Buddhas would lay down under certain conditions. The Buddha then adopted similar regulations to address the situations that arose during his time.

Q33: What significant event led to the admission of bhikkhunis into the Order according to the Vinaya Pitaka?
A33: After spending four vassas (residence period during the rains) following his Enlightenment, the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, his native city. Mahapajapati, the Buddha's foster mother, requested admission into the Order, along with five hundred Sakyan ladies whose husbands had left the household life.

Q34: Describe the circumstances surrounding Mahapajapati's request for admission into the Order.
A34: After the death of King Suddhodana, Mahapajapati, the determined foster mother of the Buddha, cut off her hair and put on bark-dyed clothes. Accompanied by five hundred Sakyan ladies, she went to Vesali where the Buddha was staying in the Mahavana, in the Kutagara Hall.

Q35: How did Venerable Ananda intervene in the matter of admitting Mahapajapati and the Sakyan ladies into the Order?
A35: Venerable Ananda, seeing Mahapajapati and the Sakyan ladies outside the Kutagara Hall, interceded with the Buddha on their behalf. Although the Buddha initially stood firm, Ananda appealed to his compassion, highlighting Mahapajapati's service as the Buddha's guardian and nurse. Ananda also emphasized that women were capable of attaining Magga and Phala Insight.

Q36: What condition did the Buddha set for Mahapajapati's admission to the Order of bhikkhunis?
A36: The Buddha finally acceded to Ananda's entreaties, stating that if Mahapajapati accepted eight special rules (garu-dhamma), her acceptance would mean her admission to the Order of bhikkhunis.

Q37: What are the eight special rules imposed on bhikkhunis for admission into the Order according to the Vinaya Pitaka?
A37: The eight special rules are:

(i) A bhikkhuni, regardless of seniority, must pay respect to a bhikkhu, even if he has been a bhikkhu for only a day.

(ii) A bhikkhuni must not keep her rains-residence in a place where there are no bhikkhus.

(iii) Every fortnight, a bhikkhuni must ask the bhikkhu Samgha for the day of uposatha and approach them for instruction and admonition.

(iv) At the end of the rains-residence period, a bhikkhuni must attend the pavarana ceremony in both the assemblies of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, inviting criticism on her actions.

(v) If a bhikkhuni commits a Samghadisesa offence, she must undergo a half-month of penance in each assembly of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis.

(vi) Admission to the Order must be sought by a woman novice only after two years of probationary training as a candidate.

(vii) A bhikkhuni should not revile a bhikkhu in any way, not even obliquely.

(viii) A bhikkhuni must abide by instructions given by bhikkhus but must not give instructions or advice to bhikkhus.

Q38: How did Mahapajapati respond to the eight conditions imposed by the Buddha for her admission into the Order?
A38: Mahapajapati accepted unhesitatingly the eight conditions imposed by the Buddha, and as a result, she was admitted into the Order of bhikkhunis.

Q39: How is the Vinaya Pitaka structured in terms of books, and what are their names?
A39: The Vinaya Pitaka is comprised of five books:
1. Parajika Pali
2. Pacittiya Pali
3. Mahavagga Pali
4. Culavagga Pali
5. Parivara Pali

Q40: What is the focus of Book I, Parajika Pali, in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A40: Parajika Pali, which is Book I of the Vinaya Pitaka, provides a detailed explanation of important rules of discipline, particularly focusing on Parajika and Samghadisesa, as well as minor offences like Aniyata and Nissaggiya.

Q41: What does Parajika discipline entail, and what are its consequences for a transgressor?
A41: Parajika discipline consists of four sets of rules designed to prevent four grave offences. A transgressor of these rules loses the status of a bhikkhu automatically. They are no longer recognized as a member of the bhikkhu community and cannot become a bhikkhu again. The options are either to return to lay life as a layman or revert back to the status of a samanera, a novice.

Q42: How are the consequences of transgressing Parajika rules described in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A42: A transgressor of Parajika rules is likened to:
   (i) a person whose head has been cut off from his body, unable to regain life even if reattached;
   (ii) leaves fallen off a tree, incapable of turning green even if reattached to the leaf-stalks;
   (iii) a flat rock that has been split, unable to be made whole again;
   (iv) a palm tree cut off from its stem, which will never grow again.


Q43: What are the four Parajika offences in the Vinaya Pitaka, and what are their consequences for a bhikkhu?
A43: The four Parajika offences are:

(i) The first Parajika: Bhikkhu engaging in sexual intercourse loses his bhikkhuhood.
(ii) The second Parajika: Bhikkhu taking with intention to steal what is not given loses his bhikkhuhood.
(iii) The third Parajika: Bhikkhu intentionally depriving a human being of life loses his bhikkhuhood.
(iv) The fourth Parajika: Bhikkhu falsely claiming attainments he does not possess, such as jhana or Magga and Phala Insight, loses his bhikkhuhood.

The Parajika offender ceases to be a bhikkhu, and the offense is irremediable.

Q44: How does the Samghadisesa discipline operate in the Vinaya Pitaka, and what are the penalties for transgressors?
A44: Samghadisesa discipline comprises thirteen rules requiring formal participation of the Samgha in the process of making the offender free from guilt. The process involves:

(i) The bhikkhu confessing the offence to the Samgha and observing the parivasa penance.
(ii) After the parivasa observance, undergoing a further penance, manatta, for six days.
(iii) Requesting reinstatement to full association with the Samgha.
(iv) The Samgha, convinced of the bhikkhu's conduct, lifting the apatti at a special congregation attended by at least twenty bhikkhus.

Q45: What is the penalty for concealing an offence in the Samghadisesa discipline?
A45: The penalty for concealing an offence in the Samghadisesa discipline is the requirement to observe the parivasa penance for as many days as the bhikkhu has knowingly concealed his offence.

Q46: Can you provide examples of Samghadisesa offences as outlined in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A46: Examples of Samghadisesa offences include:

(i) Kayasamsagga offence: Bhikkhu engaging in bodily contact with a woman, such as holding hands, caressing hair, or touching any part of her body, with lustful, perverted thoughts.

(ii) Sancaritta offence: Bhikkhu acting as a go-between for a man and a woman, facilitating their living together as husband and wife or arranging temporary relationships as man and mistress or woman and lover.

Q47: What is the meaning of Aniyata, and what are the two Aniyata offences and their determination process?
A47: Aniyata means indefinite or uncertain. The two Aniyata offences involve situations where it is uncertain whether they are Parajika, Samghadisesa, or Pacittiya offences. The determination is made based on the following rules:

(i) If a bhikkhu privately sits alone with a woman in a secluded place convenient for an immoral purpose, and a trustworthy lay woman accuses him of a Parajika, Samghadisesa, or Pacittiya offence, and the bhikkhu admits to sitting in that manner, he is found guilty of the accused offence.

(ii) If a bhikkhu privately sits alone with a woman in a place not hidden from view but convenient for talking lewd words, and a trustworthy lay woman accuses him of a Samghadisesa or Pacittiya offence, and the bhikkhu admits to sitting in that manner, he is found guilty of the accused offence.

Q48: What is the purpose of the Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences, and can you provide an example of such an offence?
A48: The Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences, totaling thirty, aim to curb inordinate greed among bhikkhus for material possessions such as robes and bowls. An example is when a bhikkhu acquires objects not permitted or exceeds the permitted quantity. The penalty involves giving up the wrongfully acquired objects, confessing the breach, and undertaking not to repeat the offence to the Samgha, a group of bhikkhus, or an individual bhikkhu to whom the objects have been surrendered.

Q49: Can you provide examples of Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences as outlined in the Vinaya Pitaka?
A49: Examples of Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences include:

(i) First Nissaggiya Sikkhapada: Bhikkhu keeping more than the permissible number of robes, such as the lower robe, the upper robe, and the great robe, must surrender the extra robes and confess the offence.

(ii) Civara Acchindana Sikkhapada: Bhikkhu giving away his own robe to another bhikkhu and later, out of anger or displeasure, forcibly taking it back or causing someone else to take it away, commits a Nissaggiya Pacittiya offence.

Q50: What is the distinction between Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences and the more severe Parajika and Samghadisesa offences?
A50: Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences are considered lighter compared to the grave offences of Parajika and Samghadisesa. While Parajika and Samghadisesa offences entail severe consequences such as loss of bhikkhuhood, Nissaggiya Pacittiya offences involve surrendering wrongfully acquired objects and admitting the offence to a bhikkhu.

Q51: What does Pacittiya Pali, Book II of the Vinaya Pitaka, primarily deal with, and can you provide examples of Pacittiya offences?
A51: Pacittiya Pali, Book II of the Vinaya Pitaka, primarily deals with Pacittiya, Patidesaniya, Sekhiya, Adhikaranasamatha, and corresponding disciplinary rules for bhikkhunis. Examples of Pacittiya offences include:

(i) Deliberate lying: Telling a deliberate lie is a Pacittiya offence.
(ii) Sleeping under the same roof with a woman: A bhikkhu sleeping under the same roof and within the walls with a woman commits a Pacittiya offence.
(iii) Digging the ground: A bhikkhu who digs the ground or causes it to be dug commits a Pacittiya offence.

Q52: How is a Pacittiya offence typically remedied according to the Vinaya Pitaka?
A52: A Pacittiya offence is remedied merely by admitting the offence to a bhikkhu.

Q53: What are the Patidesaniya offences, and can you provide an example along with the admission formula?
A53: There are four Patidesaniya offences related to a bhikkhu's conduct in accepting and eating alms-food. An example is the first rule, and the admission formula is as follows:

(i) First Patidesaniya offence: If a bhikkhu eats hard or soft food accepted with his own hand from a bhikkhuni who is not his relation and who has gone among houses for alms-food, the bhikkhu should admit his fault by saying, "Friend, I have done a censurable thing which is unbecoming and should be admitted. I admit having committed a Patidesaniya offence."

Q54: Can you provide the background for the laying down of the first Patidesaniya rule?
A54: The events leading to the laying down of the first Patidesaniya rule occurred in Savatthi. One morning, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis were going around for alms-food. A certain bhikkhuni offered her food to a bhikkhu, and he took away all that was in her bowl, leaving her without any food for the day. This happened for three consecutive days, leading the bhikkhuni to become famished. On the fourth day, she fainted and fell down due to weakness. Upon hearing about this, the Buddha censured the guilty bhikkhu and laid down the first Patidesaniya rule.

Q55: What is the significance of the Seventy-five Sekhiya rules of polite behaviour?
A55: The Seventy-five Sekhiya rules are originally laid down for the proper behavior of bhikkhus, applicable to novices seeking admission to the Order as well. These rules aim to ensure polite and disciplined conduct. They are divided into four groups: good conduct when entering towns and villages, polite manners when accepting alms-food and eating meals, prohibition of teaching the Dhamma to disrespectful people, and rules regarding unbecoming ways of answering the calls of nature and spitting.

Q56: What does the term "Adhikaranasamatha" refer to in the context of the Vinaya Pitaka, and how does it conclude the disciplinary rules for bhikkhus?
A56: "Adhikaranasamatha" in the Vinaya Pitaka refers to the seven ways of settling disputes. It concludes the disciplinary rules for bhikkhus by providing precise and detailed methods for settling various cases that may arise among the Order.

Q57: What are the four kinds of cases listed under Adhikaranasamatha, and can you provide examples of each?
A57: The four kinds of cases listed under Adhikaranasamatha are:

(i) Vivadadhikarana: Disputes about what is dhamma, what is not dhamma; what is Vinaya, what is not Vinaya; what the Buddha said, what the Buddha did not say; and what constitutes an offence, what is not an offence.

(ii) Anuvadadhikarana: Accusations and disputes arising from them regarding the virtue, practice, views, and way of living of a bhikkhu.

(iii) Apat­tadhikarana: Infringement of any disciplinary rule.

(iv) Kiccadhikarana: Formal meetings or decisions made by the Samgha.

Q58: What are the seven ways of settling disputes under Adhikaranasamatha, and can you explain the method known as "Sammukha Vinaya"?
A58: The seven ways of settling disputes under Adhikaranasamatha are:

(i) Sammukha Vinaya: Conducting an inquiry in the presence of both parties before making a decision, following the rules of Vinaya.

(ii) Sati Vinaya: Declaring the innocence of an Arahat against whom allegations have been made after asking if he remembers committing the offence.

(iii) Amulha Vinaya: Declaring innocence by the Samgha when the accused is found to be insane.

(iv) Patinnata Karana: Making a decision after admission by the party concerned.

(v) Yebhuyyasika Kamma: Making a decision based on the majority vote.

(vi) Tassapapiyasika Kamma: Declaring innocence by the Samgha when the accused proves to be unreliable, making admissions only to retract them, evading questions, and telling lies.

(vii) Tinavattharaka Kamma: Exonerating all offences except Parajika, Samghadisesa, and those involving laymen and laywomen when the disputing parties reconcile under the Samgha's guidance.

Q59: How do the rules of discipline for bhikkhunis differ from those for bhikkhus, and what are the key categories of disciplinary rules for both?
A59: The rules of discipline for bhikkhunis differ from those for bhikkhus in terms of their quantity. The bhikkhuni rules are drawn up on the same lines as those for bhikkhus, with the exception of the two Aniyata rules, which are not laid down for the bhikkhuni Order. The key categories of disciplinary rules for both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are:

1. Parajika: Bhikkhus have 4, while bhikkhunis have 8.
2. Samghadisesa: Bhikkhus have 13, while bhikkhunis have 17.

8. Adhikaranasamatha: Both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis have 7 each.

Q60: How are the rules of discipline for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis treated in the Vinaya Pitaka, and what information is provided for each rule?
A60: The rules of discipline for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are treated in detail in the first two books of the Vinaya Pitaka. For each rule, an historical account is given explaining how it came to be laid down. This is followed by an exhortation by the Buddha, concluding with "This offence does not lead to rousing faith in those who are not convinced of the Teaching, nor to the increase of faith in those who are convinced." After the exhortation, the specific rule laid down by the Buddha is presented, followed by a word-for-word commentary on the rule.

Q61: What is the content of Mahavagga Pali, and what topics are covered in its sections?
A61: Mahavagga Pali, which is Book III of the Vinaya Pitaka, is made up of ten sections known as Khandhakas.

Question: How is the Suttanta Pitaka divided?

Answer:
The Suttanta Pitaka is divided into five separate collections known as Nikayas. These are:
1. Digha Nikaya
2. Majjhima Nikaya
3. Samyutta Nikaya
4. Anguttara Nikaya
5. Khuddaka Nikaya

Question: What pragmatic aspects of the Buddha's teachings are found in the Suttanta Pitaka?

Answer:
The Suttanta Pitaka not only presents the fundamentals of the Dhamma but also provides pragmatic guidelines for making the teachings meaningful and applicable to daily life. It outlines observances and practices that constitute practical steps within the Noble Eightfold Path, leading to spiritual purification at three levels:

1. Sila (Moral Purity): Achieved through right conduct, adhering to ethical principles.
  
2. Samadhi (Purity of Mind): Attained through concentration, particularly Samatha meditation, promoting mental purity.
  
3. Panna (Purity of Insight): Cultivated through Vipassana Meditation, leading to clear insight.

Question: What is the initial step in these practices according to the Suttanta Pitaka?

Answer:
The initial step involves making the right resolution to take refuge in the Buddha, follow the Buddha's Teaching, and be guided by the Samgha. The declaration of faith in the Buddha and commitment to his teachings are exemplified by the story of Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchant brothers who offered honey rice cakes to the Buddha after his Enlightenment. The Buddha accepted their offering, and they became his disciples by reciting the formula of declaration of faith:

1. "Buddham Saranam Gacchami" (I take refuge in the Buddha).
2. "Dhammam Saranam Gacchami" (I take refuge in the Dhamma).

Later, with the establishment of the Samgha, the formula was extended to include the third commitment:
3. "Samgham Saranam Gacchami" (I take refuge in the Samgha).

Q66: What practical guidance does the Buddha provide on charity and alms-giving?
A66:

Question: What practical guidance does the Buddha provide on charity and alms-giving?

Answer:
The Buddha offers practical guidance on charity and alms-giving, emphasizing the virtues and the right way to approach these acts for spiritual upliftment.

Explanation:
Charity, or the act of giving alms, is considered a meritorious action, and the key driving force behind it is volition—the will to give. The Buddha outlines three types of volition involved in the act of giving alms:

1. Pubba Cetana (volition before the act):
   - This is the volition that begins with the thought, "I shall make an offering."
   - It exists during the period of preparations leading up to the actual act of giving.

2. Munca Cetana (volition during the act):
   - This is the volition that arises at the moment of making the offering while handing it over to the recipient.

3. Apara Cetana (volition after the act):
   - This is the volition accompanying the joy and rejoicing that arise during repeated recollection or reflection on the act of giving after it has been performed.

The Buddha's teachings emphasize that the purity of intention and the quality of volition play a crucial role in the effectiveness of charitable actions. The right attitude of mind and a genuine, selfless intention are essential components for spiritual development through acts of charity.

Q67: How does the Buddha emphasize the importance of volition in acts of charity and alms-giving?
A67:

Question: How does the Buddha emphasize the importance of volition in acts of charity and alms-giving?

Answer:
The Buddha emphasizes that the nature of the result of an offering, whether made to the living Buddha or a minute particle of his relics, is determined by the strength and purity of the volition behind the act. The quality of volition plays a crucial role in shaping the outcome of charitable actions.

Explanation:
1. Nature of the Result:
   - Regardless of whether the offering is made in homage to the living Buddha or a relic, the decisive factor is the volition behind the act.
   - The strength and purity of the volition determine the nature of the result.

2. Wrong Attitude to Avoid:
   - The Buddha cautions against a wrong attitude while giving alms.
   - Donors should avoid looking down on others who cannot make similar offerings and should not exult over their own charity.
   - Volition tainted by such unworthy thoughts is considered of inferior grade.

3. Mediocre Volition:
   - When charity is motivated by expectations of immediate prosperity, happiness, or favorable rebirth, the volition accompanying such acts is classified as mediocre.

4. Superior Volition:
   - Acts of alms-giving performed with a spirit of renunciation, motivated by pure selflessness and aspiring for Nibbana, are regarded as having a superior-grade volition.

5. Examples in Discourses:
   - The discourses provide numerous examples and guidance regarding charity and the right mindset for giving alms.

Question: What is the relationship between Sila (morality) and Samadhi (concentration) in the Buddhist path, and how is mental cultivation for the development of concentration (Samadhi Bhavana) described?

Answer:
The relationship between Sila (morality) and Samadhi (concentration) in the Buddhist path is integral and sequential. Sila serves as the foundation for Samadhi, and together, they pave the way for further progress on the path. Mental cultivation for the development of concentration, known as Samadhi Bhavana, involves purifying the mind from defilements, achieving one-pointedness of mind through focused meditation, and ultimately attaining tranquility and insight.

Q69: What are the practical methods of mental cultivation for the development of Insight Knowledge (panna) in Buddhism, and how does it relate to the understanding of Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-Self?

Question: What are the practical methods of mental cultivation for the development of Insight Knowledge (panna) in Buddhism, and how does it relate to the understanding of Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-Self?

Answer:
The practical methods of mental cultivation for the development of Insight Knowledge (panna) in Buddhism involve directing the concentrated mind towards Vipassana meditation. After achieving samadhi (concentration), the meditator discerns the three characteristics of the phenomenal world: Impermanence (Anicca), Suffering (Dukkha), and Non-Self (Anatta). This Insight Knowledge leads to a profound understanding of the nature of existence, and as the mind becomes purified, the practitioner progresses to the knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavakkhaya nana).

Explanation:
1. Attainment of Samadhi:
   - The practitioner begins by achieving samadhi, a concentrated and purified state of mind through meditation practices.

2. Transition to Insight Knowledge (Vipassana):
   - After establishing samadhi, the meditator directs the mind towards Insight Knowledge, Vipassana nana.

3. Discernment of Three Characteristics:
   - The focus of Vipassana meditation is on discerning the three characteristics of the phenomenal world:
     - Impermanence (Anicca): Recognition of the transient and ever-changing nature of all phenomena.
     - Suffering (Dukkha): Understanding the inherent unsatisfactory and stressful nature of conditioned existence.
     - Non-Self (Anatta): Insight into the absence of a permanent, unchanging self in all phenomena.

4. Knowledge of the Extinction of Moral Intoxicants:
   - As the meditator advances in practice, the purified mind is directed to the knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavakkhaya nana).

5. Understanding of Dukkha and Asavas:
   - The practitioner gains a profound understanding of dukkha, its cause, cessation, and the path leading to its cessation.
   - There is a comprehensive understanding of moral intoxicants (asavas), their nature, cause, cessation, and the path leading to their cessation.

6. Realization of Four Noble Truths:
   - The Insight Knowledge leads to a deep realization of the Four Noble Truths:
     - Dukkha (suffering),
     - The cause of dukkha (craving),
     - The cessation of dukkha (Nibbana),
     - The path leading to the cessation of dukkha (Noble Eightfold Path).

7. Complete Understanding of Existence:
   - Through the development of Insight Knowledge, the practitioner gains a complete understanding of the nature of existence and the path to liberation.

Question: How does the knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavas) lead to liberation in Buddhism?

Answer:
The knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavas) in Buddhism leads to liberation by marking the culmination of the practitioner's spiritual journey. As the meditator progresses through Insight Knowledge, understanding Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-Self, the knowledge of asavakkhaya signifies liberation. The practitioner realizes that rebirth is no more, having lived the holy life and fulfilled the requirements for the realization of the Noble Eightfold Path (Magga).

Explanation:

Progression in Meditation:

The practitioner progresses through meditation, starting with the development of samadhi (concentration) and then transitioning to Insight Knowledge (Vipassana).
Discernment of Three Characteristics:

Through Vipassana meditation, the meditator discerns the three characteristics of Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-Self in all phenomena.
Knowledge of Extinction of Moral Intoxicants:

Advancing in practice, the meditator directs the mind towards the knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavakkhaya nana).
Liberation and Knowledge of Non-Rebirth:

The knowledge of asavakkhaya signifies liberation. The practitioner understands that rebirth is no longer bound to the cycle of conditioned existence (samsara).
This knowledge brings the realization that the holy life has been lived, and the necessary steps for the realization of the Noble Eightfold Path (Magga) have been fulfilled.
Completion of the Path:

The practitioner recognizes that there is nothing more to be done for the realization of liberation. The goal of the path, which is the extinction of suffering and release from conditioned existence, has been achieved.
End of the Spiritual Journey:

The knowledge of the extinction of asavas marks the culmination of the practitioner's spiritual journey. It signifies the end of the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and the attainment of Nibbana.
Buddha's Teaching for Liberation:

The Buddha's teachings emphasize one primary objective — the extinction of suffering and release from conditioned existence.
Liberation is attained through the diligent practice of meditation, including both Calm (samatha) and Insight (Vipassana) meditation, as prescribed in the suttas of the Suttanta Pitaka.
